# Lunar Client Agents
Various agents that can be used with https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-client-qt

## Explanations
#### CrackedAccount
Lets you play on singleplayer & cracked servers with lunar. The username is supplied through the agent option.

#### HitDelayFix: 
You might have noticed how your sword randomly stops swinging even though you're clicking in 1.8. This agent removes that random cooldown.  
  
This is technically an unfair advantage, so use it at your own risk.

#### LunarEnable:
Re-enables disabled mods, such as freelook and auto text hotkey.

#### LunarPacksFix:
Makes it possible to use lunar texture overlays again.

#### NoPinnedServers:
Removes pinned servers.

#### StaffEnable:
Enables staff only mods (currently just xray). Here's a showcase of lunars built-in xray: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWZsFqH9TwQ

#### TeamsAutoGG:
Makes auto gg work in teams duels.

#### RemovePlus:
Removes the lunar+ plus from the icon.
